# Git Basics for Security

This document outlines how Git supports secure software development practices and why itâ€™s a vital tool for our project.

---

## 1. Audit Trail

- **Commit History:**  
  Every commit records who made changes, when they were made, and why (via commit messages).  
- **Traceability:**  
  This history allows us to review code changes over time, helping to quickly identify and address security issues.

---

## 2. Rollback Capabilities

- **Version Reversal:**  
  If insecure code is introduced, Git lets us revert to a previous stable state.  
- **Safety Net:**  
  This minimizes downtime and risk by allowing quick recovery from mistakes.

---

## 3. Branch Isolation

- **Separate Workflows:**  
  Create branches for new features or security updates without affecting the main codebase.  
- **Safe Experimentation:**  
  Enables testing and reviews in isolation before merging into the secure main branch.

---

## 4. Collaboration & Accountability

- **Transparent Changes:**  
  Clear commit logs ensure all team contributions are visible.  
- **Peer Review:**  
  Regular code reviews are facilitated, promoting best practices and catching potential vulnerabilities early.

---

## 5. Enforcing Secure Practices

- **Consistent Guidelines:**  
  Using Git helps enforce coding standards and secure development practices across the team.  
- **Documentation:**  
  Detailed commit messages and history serve as a reference for future audits and security reviews.
